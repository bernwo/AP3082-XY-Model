# Project 3 - 2D Square Lattice XY Model

*For the final project of Computational Physics we encourage you to define your own project!*

*The only requirement we ask for is that it should be a simulation of a physics-related project (but we consider physics-related rather broad, and e.g. simulation of biological systems or an engineering problem are also absolutely ok).*
*We do advise you though to start from a project where there is some existing literature. in this way you have a starting point as well as something to compare your simulation to for validation.*

*We encourage you to discuss your project idea with us during the time of class, or remotely via the planning issue #1.*

*In any case, you need to fill in a short plan (a few lines) together with a reference to literature in the planning issue, and have it agreed by us before May 27 (i.e. latest two weeks before the presentation).*

*If you have problems to come up with a good project, we can provide you with proven project ideas. But we first want you to try coming up with your own project! Having designed your own project will also give a small bonus for the grade.*
